# MAE-5943-Unsteady-Aerodynamics
Solutions of fundamental problems (Hiemenz, Homann, Blasius, etc. ) using Julia and Pluto.
- Stokes 1st problem (flow over an infinitely long plate which moved suddenly at constant speed)
- Hiemenz Flow (two-dimensional stagnation point flow)
- Homann Flow (axisymmetric stagnation point flow)
- Blasius Flow (flow over a flat plate)
- Falkner-Skan Similarity Solution
